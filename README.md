# Binary Image Classification in Machine Learning using Google Colab


## Objective
The main objective of this project, developed for my client Abhishek Ganguly, is to perform binary image classification. We will use Google Colab, Python, and popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to build an efficient image classifier. The goal is to accurately classify images into two distinct categories based on their content.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this binary image classification project consists of a collection of images. Each image is labeled with either a positive or negative class, representing the two distinct categories we aim to classify.

## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Binary image classification is a common task in machine learning, where we aim to classify images into one of two classes. For example, we can train a model to distinguish between cats and dogs based on their images. In this guide, we will use a deep learning approach to train a model to perform binary image classification.

## 2. Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts.
- Google account to access Google Colab.
- Dataset consisting of labeled images for training and testing.

## 3. Setting up Google Colab <a name="setting-up-google-colab"></a>
- Go to Google Colab and sign in with your Google account.
- Click on "New Notebook" to create a new Colab notebook.
- Rename the notebook by clicking on the "Untitled" title at the top.
- You are now ready to start coding in the Colab environment.

## 4. Data Preparation <a name="data-preparation"></a>
- Upload your dataset to Google Colab by clicking on the folder icon on the left sidebar and selecting the relevant files.
- Import the necessary libraries in your Colab notebook:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

```

- Load and preprocess your dataset:

```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Split the dataset into features (X) and labels (y)
X = data.drop('label', axis=1)
y = data['label']

# Preprocess the data (e.g., scaling, normalization, etc.)
# ...

```

## 5. Building the Model <a name="building-the-model"></a>
- Create a model architecture using Keras:


```python
# Initialize a sequential model
model = keras.models.Sequential()

# Add layers to the model
model.add(keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
model.add(keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(keras.layers.Flatten())
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

```
- Adjust the model architecture based on your specific requirements.

## 6. Training the Model <a name="training-the-model"></a>
- Split your dataset into training and testing sets:


```python

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


```

- Train the model on the training set:


```python

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

```

- Adjust the number of epochs and batch size based on your dataset and computational resources.

## 7. Evaluating the Model <a name="evaluating-the-model"></a>
- Evaluate the model performance on the testing set:

```python

test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}')
print(f'Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.4f}')

```

- Use additional evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).

## 8. Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
Congratulations! You have successfully trained a binary image classification model using Google Colab. Remember to experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques to improve your model's performance.
